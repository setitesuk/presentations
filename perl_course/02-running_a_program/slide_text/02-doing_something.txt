Now, there is little point having a script which executes, but does nothing. So whilst we
only need:

#! /Users/ajb/dev/bin/perl -w

It's not very helpful. Let's add:

print 'Hello World!';

This shows you an instruction (statement) in perl. Let's take a look:

print

This is a keyword, or function. It is part of the base perl language, and it tells perl to
act on (in this case 'print' to screen) the next argument that it reads.

'Hello World!'

The argument to be acted upon. Some text in quotes like this are a string.
This means that we are telling perl to print to the greeting Hello World!

;

This is possibly the most important part of the whole statement. It finishes our
statement, and tells perl that it can now 'do' whatever it has just read. Leaving
this out can cause problems.

So, we run bin/hello_world.pl

ajb>bin/hello_world.pl
Hello World!ajb>

Comments:

# this is a comment to explain print (do this function on) 'Hello World!' (this string) ; (end of statement)

Whenever the compiler reaches a # symbol (apart from a couple of exceptions), it treats the rest of the line
as comment, and so will not compile anything there, even if it is code. Commenting can help you when you
come to go back over code and find out what it was trying to do, or can help you remove something quickly
during development
