Unfortunately, a big problem exists with arrays. You often have to remember at what index everything is

i.e.

my @personal_info = ( qw{Andy Brown 180 brown blue} );

I could conceivably have blue hair (dye) and what is the 180 for.
And depending on who has written the code or what country we are in, Andy could be a forename or a surname.

Thankfully we have associative arrays, or hashes.

Hashes give a name to each element, rather than an index, so we can use this to get the data.

my %personal_info = (
  forename => 'Andy',
  surname  => 'Brown',
  height   => '180',
  hair     => 'brown',
  eyes     => 'blue',
);


To access the data, we then write a similar scalar request to the array one.

say $personal_info{forename};
