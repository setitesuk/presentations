### writing a file

# we looked at the data source file, but you are going to want your results to go somewhere else, and are
# likely to want to store them in a file.

use File::Slurp;

# In bin/02-writing_a_file.pl we have an array of sequences (they would have been generated in some way),
# that we want stored into a file.

write_file( 'data/short_reads.seq', @sequences );

# check the file data/short_reads.seq. You'll see all the reads are now in there, ready to be passed on,
# archived, processed further...
